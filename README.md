# Pixela Api Wrapper
API wrapper for the habit tracking pixe.la API, Pixe.la allows you to record and track your habits or efforts all by using API.

The README is far from complete.. Feel free to send in improvements!

Even if you have an account with pixe.la, the wrapper will still run you through a first time user mode.

If you already have an account make sure to provide the correct token and username or else your API requests will come back with bad request errors.
